# Our Core Values

## Fast shipping is as important to us as the quality of the code
Remember, delivering new features and products to customers is the only thing that matters. Code quality is only important to keep up the pace and ensure we keep moving forward. It's not an end goal. No customer will ever thank you for your code, but they'll always praise you for a job well done.

## IT is a team game
Always put the team first. Helping a teammate always comes before your own schedule. We move forward as a team, there's no reason to sprint alone if others can't follow your steps.
Always appreciate the work of others. Cheer up your teammates, help them get to the next level.
And remember: leave your ego at home, the team doesn't need it.

## Be a player, be a doer
Being a team player also means giving blood, sweat and tears to help the team. Don't sit on the bench and wait for others to do the work. Get involved, be on the playground, do your best and give your best to the team.

## Perfectionism
It's ok not to be perfect, but it's not ok to know it's not perfect. Don't ship poorly made features. Your craft must be perfect, at least in your own eyes.
